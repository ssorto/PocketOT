# PocketOT

**Duke Hackathon Submission — Fall 2024**

PocketOT helps occupational therapists move faster from narrative → intervention direction.  
Clients describe daily barriers across six domains — AI structures those reflections into clinical reasoning signals — and therapists use those signals to draft focused intervention plans more quickly.

---

## Key Features
- 6-pillar client reflection assessment
- AI-assisted structuring layer (clusters reflection text → OT-relevant categories)
- Client selects top three priorities to preserve autonomy
- Therapist view showing pillar signals + directional starting point for interventions

---

## Tech Stack
- React + Vite
- TypeScript
- Node / Vercel server endpoints (for AI calls)
- OpenAI API for structured output

---

## Demo Flow
1) Client completes reflection questions  
2) Model structures narrative into clinical reasoning categories  
3) Therapist sees top pillar signals  
4) Drafts interventions from a clearer starting point
